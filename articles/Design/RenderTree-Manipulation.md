*Thoughts on Why What and How to manipulate the render-tree.*

## Operations

There are four kind of operations (i.e. CURD):

* Create: Create a node or sub-tree when needed.
* Update: Update properties of a node.
* Read: Read properties of a node.
* Delete: Delete a node or sub-tree from the render-tree.

## Implementation Thoughts

__When to create?__

1. When the application starts up, we need to create an initial render-tree hierarchy.
2. When we need to react to a user action by creating, updating, deleting the control.
3. When the control logic requests creating, updating, deleting a node or sub-tree.

__How to create in an *immediate* way?__

In retained mode GUI, nodes are created, updated and deleted when an event is triggered. 
But in an immediate mode GUI, the controls are always being updating and we do not use event to handle user input. 

Let's take the creation of a node when the application starts up for example. If we put the code of creating nodes inside the control method, 
we will adding duplcated nodes to the render-tree every time when the method is called. And that is not the expected behavior.
What we need is to create only once when the application starts up.

The first solution to this come to my mind is to use a *dirty flag*. It just works. ImGui will use this approach for now. I think there are some more flexible solutions.

After thinking and trying for a month, *dirty flags* turn out not practical in an immediate mode UI since there is no `event` in immediate mode. We will use something like the conception `hot` instead. So what is `hot`? A control is hot when it has the focus.

After having implemented render-tree-based rendering, I think that a single hot state is still enough. Some reasons:

* If the application is running on a device that supports multi-touch, then multiple controls could have the focus.
* "Focus" wiil not suffice when it comes to animation: some controls plays animation, but is not focused.

The state of a render-tree node should be:
* __normal__
* __hovered__
* __hot__
* __active__
* __disabled__

(TODO: detailed description about these states)

__When to update?__

Every frame we should check each node if it is part of a `hot` control. And if it is, we update, namely re-draw/re-layout it.

__How to determine whether a node need to up re-draw/re-layout?__ 

Manually in the control update.

Two steps:

1. Do any action that influences the looking or layout. See [*What triggers a re-layout in the render tree?*](https://github.com/zwcloud/ImGui.Docs/blob/master/articles/Design/RenderTree-Manipulation.md#implementation-thoughts).
2. Set the control hot.
3. Re-draw or re-layout.

__How to re-draw?__

Let's take `BuildInPrimitiveRenderer` on Windows for example, this is an OpenGL based renderer. Graphic data is represented as mesh.

Just come across an article about GPU-accelerated rendering of Chrome: [Accelerated Rendering in Chrome - The Layer Model](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/layers/) by Tom Wiltzius. It's better to do some research on how other existing GPU-accelerated renderer functions. A perfect option is webkit. (I have got some kownledge on how it does GPU-based rendering but that's not enough.)

But for now let's just stick to a simplest solution below.

Each node's primitive is rendered into the mesh and then rendered by `Win32OpenGLRenderer`. Only part of the mesh corresponds to the primitive. So if a node changes its primitive, the corresponding part of the mesh should be updated/recreated.

We will update mesh like this:

1. A node is to be updated because it is externally set to hot.
2. The rendering loop detects the node is hot, so it redraw the node's primitive into a mesh taken from the mesh pool. Then the mesh is added to a linked list called mesh list.
3. Clear the previous mesh buffer and append each mesh to the mesh buffer.
4. The OpenGL renderer renders the mesh buffer.

__furtherly improve current rendering pipeline__

Just luckily came across an article about FireFox's new WebRenderer: [The whole web at maximum FPS: How WebRender gets rid of jank](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/10/the-whole-web-at-maximum-fps-how-webrender-gets-rid-of-jank/).

It is a very good reference for how should ImGui implement the render-tree and OpenGL based rendering backend.

And another article about the quantum CSS engine: [Inside a super fast CSS engine: Quantum CSS (aka Stylo)](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/08/inside-a-super-fast-css-engine-quantum-css-aka-stylo/). The most important and valuable part to us in it, is *Speed up restyles with the Rule Tree*.

__basic node properties__

Node:

* `Id`: the unique identifier. It's a hashcode of some text. Not just 1, 2, 3,...

	Current Id generation method is fine. Factors that are taken into consideration, when generate an id, are: id stack, text component of the control. Text component of the control is the text directly related to the control, such as the text of a `Label` and the text on a `Button`. The id of the root node of a control is the id of the control.

* `Name`: an extra unique identifier. It's a hunman-readable text like `WindowTitle`, `Caption`, `Close Button`, etc. It will be used in the control logic to easily fetch nodes that is needed when running control logic.

* `StyleModifiers`: an list of style __modifiers__. An `StyleModifier` is an object used to override the default style, like a CSS rule that overrides the default style defined by the web browser.
	
	We don't attach a `GUIStyle` to every node because that's not necessary: we only need to know what kind of styles are changed to what for a node when rendering. A dynamic-sized modifier list is a perfect solution. The list can be null or empty, which means the default style is used.

__styling__

* Current styling is complete separated from the render-tree:

GUISkin ===have===> StyleModifiers ===applied to===> GUIStyle ===modify===> properties of a Node and its primitive ===rendered with===>Primitive renderers
														¡ü
LayoutOptions ===have===> StyleModifiers ===applied to==¡ü

There are three level of style.

1. Skin rules: the default style. `GUISkin`
2. per-Control instance rules: custom styles. `LayoutOptions` (It should be renamed to `StyleOptions`.)
3. per-Node rules (not implemented and need further consideration): used internally for custom controls
